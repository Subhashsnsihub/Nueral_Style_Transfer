# Neural Style Transfer with Streamlit

This project allows you to apply Neural Style Transfer (NST) to images using a pre-trained VGG19 model. The goal is to transfer the artistic style of a given image onto the content of another image. The process is performed using PyTorch and is presented in a simple and interactive Streamlit app.

## Features

- Upload content and style images.
- Adjust settings such as image size, style weight, and number of steps.
- Perform style transfer to generate a new image.
- Download the generated stylized image.
- Visual progress bar to show processing status.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-style-transfer.git
cd neural-style-transfer
